## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Context
```
[Users] → [NPCL Dashboard] → [PostgreSQL Database]
            ↓                      ↓
    [Redis Cache] ← → [Email Service (SMTP)]
            ↓
    [Audit Logs & Analytics]
```

### Key Components
- **Authentication System** - NextAuth.js with JWT strategy, role-based access control, and session management
- **Dashboard Analytics** - Real-time statistics, performance monitoring, and data visualization with Recharts
- **API Layer** - Next.js API routes with Prisma ORM for database operations and Redis caching
- **PWA Features** - Mobile-optimized interface, offline capabilities, and app-like experience
- **Audit System** - Comprehensive logging of user activities and system events

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates via NextAuth.js with credentials provider
2. Middleware validates JWT tokens and enforces role-based access control
3. API routes process requests with Prisma ORM and Redis caching
4. Dashboard components fetch and display real-time statistics and analytics
5. All user activities are logged to audit trail for compliance and monitoring

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### User Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via LoginForm component
2. NextAuth.js validates credentials against Prisma database
3. JWT token is generated and stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
4. Middleware validates token on subsequent requests and enforces RBAC
5. User activities are logged to audit trail for compliance

**Code path:** `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` → `lib/nextauth.ts` → `middleware.ts`

### Dashboard Statistics Workflow
1. Dashboard component requests statistics from API endpoint
2. API route checks Redis cache for existing data
3. If cache miss, queries PostgreSQL via Prisma for fresh data
4. Results are cached in Redis and returned to client
5. Dashboard renders statistics with loading states and error handling

**Code path:** `components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx` → `app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` → `lib/cache/`

## 📈 Performance & Scale

### Performance Considerations
- **Redis Caching:** Dashboard statistics cached with TTL for faster response times
- **Database Optimization:** Prisma queries with proper indexing and connection pooling
- **PWA Features:** Service worker for offline capabilities and app-like experience
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component with lazy loading and WebP support

### Monitoring
- **Web Vitals:** Core Web Vitals tracking for performance metrics
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive activity tracking for security and compliance
- **Health Checks:** API endpoints for monitoring application status

## 🚨 Things to Be Careful About

### 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with secure JWT tokens and HTTP-only cookies
- **Role-Based Access:** Middleware enforces permissions at route level
- **Password Security:** bcryptjs hashing with salt rounds for secure storage
- **Input Validation:** Zod schemas validate all user inputs and API parameters
- **Audit Trail:** All user activities logged for security monitoring
