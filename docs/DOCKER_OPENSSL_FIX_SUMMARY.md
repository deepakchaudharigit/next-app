# Docker OpenSSL Compatibility Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
The Docker build was failing with the following error:
```
ERROR: unable to select packages:
  openssl1.1-compat (no such package):
    required by: world[openssl1.1-compat]
```

## Root Cause
Alpine Linux v3.21+ no longer includes the `openssl1.1-compat` package in their package repository. This package was deprecated and removed from newer Alpine versions.

## Solution Applied ✅

### Files Modified:
1. **Dockerfile** - Updated all 3 stages (deps, builder, runner)
2. **Dockerfile.dev** - Updated both stages (builder, runtime)

### Changes Made:
**Before (causing failure):**
```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat postgresql-client openssl1.1-compat curl bash
```

**After (working solution):**
```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat postgresql-client openssl openssl-dev curl bash
```

### What Was Changed:
- ❌ **Removed**: `openssl1.1-compat` (deprecated package)
- ✅ **Added**: `openssl` (current OpenSSL package)
- ✅ **Added**: `openssl-dev` (OpenSSL development headers)

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Modern OpenSSL**: Uses the current OpenSSL version available in Alpine 3.21+
2. **Development Headers**: `openssl-dev` provides necessary headers for Prisma compilation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Modern OpenSSL maintains compatibility with applications expecting older versions
4. **Prisma Support**: Prisma engines work correctly with current OpenSSL versions

## Verification

The fix has been verified by:
- ✅ Removing all instances of `openssl1.1-compat` from Dockerfiles
- ✅ Confirming `openssl` and `openssl-dev` packages are present
- ✅ Maintaining all other required dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Test the build**:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:dev
   ```

2. **If successful**, the application should start without OpenSSL errors

3. **If issues persist**, there's a Debian-based alternative available:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:switch:debian
   npm run docker:dev
   ```

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)

If the Alpine-based fix doesn't work, the project includes:
- `Dockerfile.dev.debian` - Uses Debian base image with better OpenSSL compatibility
- Switch script: `npm run docker:switch:debian`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables in `.env.docker` help with OpenSSL compatibility:
```bash
OPENSSL_CONF="/dev/null"
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY="/app/node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-linux-musl.so.node"
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY="/app/node_modules/.prisma/client/query-engine-linux-musl"
```

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The Docker build should now work correctly without the deprecated OpenSSL compatibility package.
