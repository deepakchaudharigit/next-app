# Docker Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
npm error The npm ci command can only install with an existing package-lock.json
```

## Root Cause
The `.dockerignore` file was excluding `package-lock.json`, but the `Dockerfile.dev` was trying to copy it and run `npm ci`. This caused the build to fail because `npm ci` requires the lock file to exist.

## Fix Applied
Updated `.dockerignore` to allow `package-lock.json` to be included in the Docker build context:

**Before:**
```
# Package lock files (use npm ci instead)
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
```

**After:**
```
# Package lock files (keep package-lock.json for npm ci)
# package-lock.json  # Keep this for npm ci
yarn.lock
```

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clean up any existing containers and images:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
   docker system prune -f
   ```

2. **Rebuild and start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   npm run docker:dev
   ```

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - The build should complete successfully
   - PostgreSQL container should start and be healthy
   - The app container should build without npm ci errors
   - Development server should start on http://localhost:3000

## Additional Notes

### Environment Configuration
- The project uses `.env.docker` for Docker-specific environment variables
- Development uses port 5433 for PostgreSQL to avoid conflicts with local installations
- Hot reloading is enabled through volume mounts in development mode

### Development Services Available
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5433 (external), postgres:5432 (internal)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **Adminer** (with dev-tools profile): http://localhost:8080
- **Mailhog** (with dev-tools profile): http://localhost:8025

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Start with development tools (Adminer, Mailhog)
npm run docker:dev:tools

# View logs
npm run docker:logs
npm run docker:logs:app
npm run docker:logs:db

# Access container shell
npm run docker:shell

# Reset database
npm run docker:db:reset

# Stop everything
npm run docker:down:dev
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Fixed `.dockerignore` to include `package-lock.json`
2. ✅ Verified Docker configuration files are correct
3. ✅ Confirmed startup scripts are properly configured
4. ✅ Environment variables are properly set

The Docker development environment should now build and run successfully.
