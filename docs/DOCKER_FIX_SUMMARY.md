# Docker Development Environment - Issue Fixed

## Problem Summary
The Docker development environment was failing with the error:
```
/bin/bash: ./startup-dev.sh: No such file or directory
npcl-dashboard-dkch exited with code 127
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile was attempting to copy the startup script from `./scripts/docker/startup-dev-simple.sh` to `./startup-dev.sh`, but this copy operation was failing, causing the container to repeatedly crash.

## Solution Applied
1. **Modified Dockerfile.dev**: Changed to execute the script directly from its original location instead of copying it
2. **Updated docker-compose.dev.yml**: Updated the command to use the correct script path
3. **Added helper scripts**: Created convenience scripts for easier Docker management

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile.dev` - Fixed script execution path
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Updated command to use correct script path  
- `package.json` - Added `docker:stop` alias
- Created helper scripts and documentation

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Using npm scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop any running containers
npm run docker:stop

# Start development environment
npm run docker:dev
```

### Option 2: Using Docker Compose directly
```bash
# Stop containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Start with rebuild
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Option 3: Using helper scripts (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x restart-docker-dev.sh stop-docker-dev.sh

# Restart development environment
./restart-docker-dev.sh
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
When you run the development environment, you should see:

1. **PostgreSQL** starting and becoming ready
2. **Redis** starting successfully  
3. **App container** building without errors
4. **Startup script** executing with output showing:
   - Environment debug information
   - PostgreSQL connection waiting and success
   - Prisma client generation
   - Database schema push
   - Database seeding
   - Development server starting on port 3000

## Verification Steps
Once containers are running:
1. **Application**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Health check**: http://localhost:3000/api/health
3. **Check logs**: `npm run docker:logs:app`

## Additional Resources Created
- `DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide
- `restart-docker-dev.sh` - Helper script to restart development environment
- `stop-docker-dev.sh` - Helper script to stop containers

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run docker:dev` to start the development environment
2. Verify the application loads at http://localhost:3000
3. Check that all services are healthy using the health check endpoint

The Docker development environment should now start successfully without the startup script errors.
