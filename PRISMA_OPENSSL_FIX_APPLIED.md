# Prisma OpenSSL Docker Fix - Applied

## Problem Summary

Your NPCL Dashboard was experiencing Docker startup failures due to OpenSSL compatibility issues between Alpine Linux and Prisma's query engine. The specific error was:

```
Error loading shared library libssl.so.1.1: No such file or directory
```

This occurred because:
1. Alpine Linux 3.21+ uses OpenSSL 3.x
2. Prisma's query engine expects OpenSSL 1.1.x libraries
3. The `libssl.so.1.1` file was missing in the Alpine container

## Solution Applied

### 1. Switched to Debian-based Docker Images

**Changed:**
- `Dockerfile.dev`: From `node:18-alpine` to `node:18-slim` (Debian-based)
- `Dockerfile`: Updated all stages to use `node:18-slim` consistently

**Why:** Debian-based images have better OpenSSL compatibility with Prisma's requirements.

### 2. Updated Prisma Engine Configuration

**Changed:**
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`: Removed Alpine-specific Prisma engine paths
- `.env.docker`: Commented out Alpine-specific engine variables
- Let Prisma auto-detect the correct engine for the platform

**Before (Alpine):**
```bash
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY="/app/node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-linux-musl.so.node"
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY="/app/node_modules/.prisma/client/query-engine-linux-musl"
```

**After (Debian):**
```bash
# Let Prisma auto-detect the correct engine for better compatibility
# Prisma will automatically use the correct Debian/glibc engines
```

### 3. Updated Package Manager Commands

**Changed:**
- Alpine: `apk add --no-cache`
- Debian: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y ... && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`

### 4. Created Comprehensive Fix Script

**Created:** `fix-prisma-openssl-docker.sh`
- Automated cleanup and rebuild process
- Comprehensive testing and verification
- Error handling and troubleshooting guidance

## Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile.dev** - Switched to Debian base image
2. **Dockerfile** - Updated for consistency
3. **docker-compose.dev.yml** - Removed Alpine-specific Prisma paths
4. **.env.docker** - Updated Prisma configuration
5. **fix-prisma-openssl-docker.sh** - New comprehensive fix script
6. **run-prisma-fix.sh** - Simple runner script

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)

```bash
# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x run-prisma-fix.sh
./run-prisma-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Clean up existing containers
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -f

# 2. Rebuild with new Debian-based images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache

# 3. Start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 4. Verify the application
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Expected Results

After applying the fix:

✅ **Containers start successfully**
✅ **Prisma client generates without errors**
✅ **Database schema pushes successfully**
✅ **Database seeding completes without errors**
✅ **Application runs at http://localhost:3000**
✅ **Health endpoint responds correctly**

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check Prisma operations
docker exec npcl-dashboard-dkch npx prisma generate
docker exec npcl-dashboard-dkch npm run db:test-connection

# View logs
docker-compose logs app
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs app
   docker-compose logs postgres
   ```

2. **Verify containers are running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

3. **Complete rebuild:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   docker system prune -f
   ./run-prisma-fix.sh
   ```

4. **Use existing troubleshooting script:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/docker/troubleshoot-prisma.sh
   ```

## Technical Details

### Why Debian Works Better

1. **OpenSSL Compatibility:** Debian includes OpenSSL 1.1.x libraries that Prisma expects
2. **Glibc vs Musl:** Debian uses glibc, which has better compatibility with Node.js native modules
3. **Package Availability:** Better package ecosystem for development dependencies

### Performance Impact

- **Image Size:** Debian images are ~50MB larger than Alpine
- **Build Time:** Slightly longer due to apt-get operations
- **Runtime Performance:** Negligible difference for this application

### Security Considerations

- Debian-slim images are still minimal and security-focused
- Regular security updates available through apt
- No additional security risks compared to Alpine for this use case

## Future Maintenance

1. **Keep using Debian-based images** for consistency
2. **Monitor Prisma updates** for any engine changes
3. **Test Docker builds** after major dependency updates
4. **Use the fix script** if similar issues arise

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - OpenSSL compatibility issues resolved by switching to Debian-based Docker images.

**Next Steps:** Run the fix script and verify your application is working correctly.
