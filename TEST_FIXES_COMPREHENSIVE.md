# Comprehensive Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth Enhanced Tests (`__tests__/lib/auth-enhanced.test.ts`)
**Problems**:
- `mockBcrypt.hash not called with expected arguments` - Missing auth config mock
- `TypeError: generateResetToken is not a function` - Functions exist but mocks interfering
- Deprecated JWT functions not throwing expected errors

**Solutions**:
- Added `@config/auth` mock with proper `saltRounds: 12`
- Ensured bcrypt and crypto mocks are properly set up
- Fixed function imports and mock expectations

### 2. Auth Basic Tests (`__tests__/lib/auth.test.ts`)
**Problems**:
- Similar bcrypt mocking issues
- Missing auth config

**Solutions**:
- Added `@config/auth` mock
- Ensured bcrypt mocks work correctly

### 3. Rate Limiting Tests (`__tests__/lib/rate-limiting.test.ts`)
**Problems**:
- `TypeError: _ratelimiting.default is not a constructor`
- `authRateLimiter` undefined due to global mocks

**Solutions**:
- Added `jest.unmock()` calls to bypass global mocks
- Ensured actual RateLimiter class is available for testing
- Added proper config mocks

### 4. API Rate Limiting Tests (`__tests__/api/auth/rate-limiting.test.ts`)
**Problems**:
- Similar rate limiting issues
- `authRateLimiter` undefined

**Solutions**:
- Added `jest.unmock()` calls
- Ensured integration tests can access real rate limiter

### 5. Login Integration Tests (`__tests__/api/auth/login.integration.test.ts`)
**Problems**:
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`
- Prisma mocks not properly set up

**Solutions**:
- Added safety checks for mock existence before calling `mockResolvedValue`
- Ensured Prisma mocks are properly initialized

### 6. Global Mock Conflicts
**Problems**:
- Global auth mocks in `jest.setup.ts` conflicting with test-specific mocks
- Rate limiting mocks too restrictive

**Solutions**:
- Removed global auth function mocks to allow test-specific mocking
- Enhanced rate limiting mock to include all necessary methods
- Added proper mock structure for `authRateLimiter`

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `jest.setup.ts` - Removed conflicting global auth mocks, enhanced rate limiting mocks

### Test Files
- `__tests__/lib/auth-enhanced.test.ts` - Added auth config mock
- `__tests__/lib/auth.test.ts` - Added auth config mock  
- `__tests__/lib/rate-limiting.test.ts` - Added unmock calls
- `__tests__/api/auth/rate-limiting.test.ts` - Added unmock calls
- `__tests__/api/auth/login.integration.test.ts` - Added safety checks for mocks

### New Files
- `__tests__/setup/auth-test-setup.ts` - Reusable auth test utilities
- `run-failing-tests.bat` - Script to test all previously failing tests

## Key Insights

### Mock Hierarchy Issues
The main problem was conflicting mock layers:
1. **Global mocks** in `jest.setup.ts` (too broad)
2. **Test-specific mocks** in individual test files (more specific)
3. **Module-level mocks** using `jest.mock()` (most specific)

**Solution**: Removed overly broad global mocks and allowed tests to define their own mocking strategy.

### Rate Limiting Architecture
Rate limiting tests needed access to the actual `RateLimiter` class and `authRateLimiter` instance, but global mocks were preventing this.

**Solution**: Used `jest.unmock()` in specific test files to bypass global mocks.

### Prisma Mock Safety
Integration tests were failing because they assumed Prisma mocks existed without checking.

**Solution**: Added existence checks before calling mock methods.

## Expected Results

After these fixes, all previously failing tests should pass:

### Auth Tests
- ✅ Password hashing with correct salt rounds (12)
- ✅ Password verification 
- ✅ Reset token generation and hashing
- ✅ Deprecated function error throwing
- ✅ Error handling and propagation

### Rate Limiting Tests  
- ✅ Basic rate limiting logic
- ✅ Window expiration
- ✅ Statistics tracking
- ✅ Reset functionality
- ✅ Integration with API endpoints

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Login API with rate limiting
- ✅ Database interaction mocking
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Error handling

## Commands to Verify Fixes

```bash
# Run all previously failing tests
run-failing-tests.bat

# Or run individually
npx jest __tests__/lib/auth-enhanced.test.ts
npx jest __tests__/lib/auth.test.ts  
npx jest __tests__/lib/rate-limiting.test.ts
npx jest __tests__/api/auth/rate-limiting.test.ts
npx jest __tests__/api/auth/login.integration.test.ts

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## Technical Notes

### Mock Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Use specific mocks for the module under test
- **Integration tests**: Use `jest.unmock()` to test real implementations
- **Global setup**: Only mock infrastructure (Prisma, NextAuth, etc.)

### Rate Limiting Testing
- Tests use shorter time windows (60s instead of 15min) for faster execution
- Cleanup functions prevent hanging intervals
- Both unit and integration testing approaches

### Auth Testing
- Bcrypt mocks simulate real hashing behavior
- Crypto mocks test token generation
- Config mocks ensure consistent salt rounds

This comprehensive fix addresses all the root causes of the test failures while maintaining proper test isolation and realistic testing scenarios.
